# WASM
## what is wasm?
*WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.*

  Imagine WebAssembly, or Wasm, as a special code that helps computers understand and do cool things on the internet. It's like a secret language that computers speak. You know how we can talk to each other using words and sentences? Well, Wasm is a way for programmers to talk to computers and tell them what to do.

Wasm is like a super-smart translator. It takes instructions from different programming languages and turns them into a special kind of code that computers can understand. This code is like a set of rules that tell the computer how to do things.

With the help of Wasm, programmers can make fun games and interactive websites that you can play with on the internet. It's a bit like having a magic box that can make things work on computers and the internet.

Wasm is very clever because it can work on different computers and devices, like phones, tablets, and even big servers. This means that programmers can create programs and apps that can run on many different things, which is super useful!

Some say wasm is "running compiled code in Javascript" means we first compile the code into a wasn binary and run the code on webapps. (super simplified).
